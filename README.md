# Fractals
Fractals Project - MathFest Finalist  Developed a fractals project utilizing Unity's compute shaders and the ray marching algorithm, resulting in real-time rendering of complex fractals. This project was presented at our university's MathFest competition, where it achieved recognition as one of the finalists.
